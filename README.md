The vision of andromedai is to make education the best it can possibly be. 
For now we want to create a **much** better model specifically for technical 
education.

**Our mission** is to create a self sustaining community of people who are 
both students and teachers. Provide a very affordable alternative to college 
and allow teachers to make a good living teaching what they are 
passionate about.

There are so many people in the world that do not have the support system 
or enough money to attend college. The hope is that this site will allow 
anyone to get a world class education in a community where students look 
forward to learning without worrying about grades or cost and where 
teachers are paid well for their knowledge and wisdom.

Below we have outlined what we believe to be the three biggest problems
in technical education. Contribute your ideas on the best type of 
technical education should work in our [wiki][1] or contribute
to this README.md file with a pull request. Don't know how to make
a pull request or how to use this website? We made an easy 1.5 
hour [playlist][2] on how to use this website.

## Quality of Education Resources

### Problem 1:
How often do you zone out or are too nervous to ask questions in class? Class environments can be intimidating, and the pace may be too fast/slow for *your* learning style. A [study][3] of 777 students at 6 colleges and universities found that more than 90% of students admit to using their devices for non-class activities. Of those 55% reported using their device to avoid boredom.

### Possible Solution:

We want to make education open source. List the most up-to-date, relevant, and engaging free online courses. It worked for an encyclopedia so why not for a website with all of the best videos, assignments, and quizzes. Give students the ability to edit the site, making it better over time. Only the highest quality & relevant videos, quizzes, and projects are kept alive on the website through user up votes and low quality or outdated material is removed when it is no longer the most popular (Maybe implement a weight system like reddit).

## Motivation & Cost

### Problem 2 & 3:

The drop out rate of online websites like coursera.org is ver low. A [study][4] showed a 7.7% average drop out rate. Meanwhile, the cost of technical college education continues to rise at an extremly fast rate even when [compared][5] to the housing market or the CPI (consumer price index).

### Possible Solution: 

All courses on the website can be viewed at any time. To encourage user motivation popular courses on the website will have labs where people in local communities can pay a small *fee* and sign up to have teachers help you if you are struggling with anything!

#### Students Perspective

A student interested in learning the newest software tools would go to the website and sign up for a lab section in their local community and pay a fee. Each lab section will make available a list of the instructors along with their ratings (given anonymously by previous students). At the lab there will be several instructors helping the students.

The material for the lab is open source & free, embracing the Wikipedia model. Specially for instruction based labs that teach a concept instead of purely informational articles.

On the day of the lab, the student can read through the material beforehand. When at the lab students will be partnered (if appropriate) and will have the instructurs at hand to solve any issues. Afterwards, students will complete an optional teacher rating survey.

Each instructor will be evaluated on several criteria to ensure a consistent and pleasant experience for students.

#### Intructors Perspective

Students that have gone through a certain number of labs and who want to earn money can apply for a teaching position on one of the labs they completed. How much is the average teacher paid in America? Not very well. We would like to pay instructors very well.

One approach is to take the money paid by the students, subtract any operating costs and distribute the rest among the instructors of the lab.
