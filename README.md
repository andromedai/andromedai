The vision of andromedai is to make education the best it can possibly be. 
For now we want to create a **much** better model specifically for technical 
education.

**Our mission** is to create a self sustaining community of people who are 
both students and teachers. Provide a very affordable alternative to college 
and allow teachers to make a good living teaching what they are 
passionate about.

There are so many people in the world that do not have the support system 
or enough money to attend college. The hope is that this site will allow 
anyone to get a world class education in a community where students look 
forward to learning without worrying about grades or cost and where 
teachers are paid well for their knowledge and wisdom.

Below we have outlined what we believe to be the three biggest problems
in technical education. Contribute your ideas on how the best type of 
technical education should work in our [wiki][1] or contribute
to this README.md file with a pull request. Don't know how to make
a pull request or how to use this website? We made an easy 1.5 
hour [playlist][2] on how to use this website.

## Quality of Education Resources

### Problem 1:
How often do you zone out or are too nervous to ask questions in class? 
Class environments can be intimidating, and the pace may be too fast/slow
for *your* learning style. A [study][3] of 777 students at 6 colleges 
and universities found that more than 90% of students admit to using 
their devices for non-class activities during class. Of those 55% 
reported using their device to avoid boredom.

### Possible Solution:
We want to make education open source. List the most up-to-date, relevant, 
and engaging free online labs(2 hour class on how to apply a specific 
technology or idea) for anyone to do. Why isn't there a website with all 
of the best videos, assignments, and quizzes? And teachers will have the
ability to edit the site, making it better over time. Only the highest 
quality and relevant videos, quizzes, and projects are kept alive on 
the website through user up votes and low quality or outdated material 
is removed when it is no longer the most popular.

## Motivation & Cost

### Problem 2 & 3:
The drop out rate of online learning websites like coursera.org is very 
high. A [study][4] showed a 92.3% average drop out rate. Meanwhile, the 
cost of technical college education continues to rise at an extremly 
fast rate even when [compared][5] to the housing market or the CPI
(consumer price index).

### Possible Solution: 
All courses on the website can be viewed at any time. To encourage user
motivation popular courses on the website will have labs(2 hour class)
where people in local communities can pay a small *fee* and sign up to 
have teachers help you if you are struggling with anything!

#### Students Perspective
A student interested in learning the newest software tools would go to 
the website and sign up for a lab section in their local community and 
pay a fee. Each lab section will make available a list of the 
instructors along with their ratings (given anonymously by previous 
students). During the lab there will be several instructors helping 
the students.

The material for the lab is open source & free, embracing the Wikipedia 
model. Specially for instruction based labs that teach a concept 
instead of purely informational lectures.

On the day of the lab, the student can read through the material 
beforehand. When at the lab students will be partnered (if appropriate) 
and will have multiple teachers at hand to solve any issues. Afterwards, 
students will complete an optional teacher rating survey.

Each teacher will be evaluated on several criteria to ensure a 
consistent and pleasant experience for students.

#### Teacher Perspective
Students that have gone through a certain number of labs and who want 
to earn money can apply for a teaching position on one of the labs 
they have completed. Our current plan is to take the money paid by the
students, subtract any operating costs and distribute the rest among 
the teachers of the lab.
